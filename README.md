# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe

Like Regular Tic Tac Toe, theres a 3x3 grid to play on, but every cell of the grid has a mini grid.

Rules:
X starts, in any cell of any mini grid.

wherever X is placed in the mini grid, (lets assume x is placed in the bottom left of a mini grid) 
O must play in the corresponding mini grid (O must play in the bottom left of the main grid)
and vice versa.

If X or O get 3 in a row in any of the mini grids, the mini grid will be claimed by X or O respectively

To Win, you must claim 3 cells of the main grid in a row.

Im sure theres an easier way to explain it, id recommend just giving it a shot with a friend.
